# What is Turbo?

Turbo is my personal request library used for bypassing cybersecurity checks.
I was using CycleTLS for a while, but I found it has issues and wasn't maintained the best.
I also read things talking about high proxy usage from CycleTLS and it had issues working on my mac.
Since I want DalphanAIO to be working on both PC and Mac, building my own request library was the best route.
